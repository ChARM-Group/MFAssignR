<h2>Package Overview and References</h2>
<p>The MFAssignR package was designed for multi-element molecular formula (MF) assignment of ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry measurements. A number of tools for internal mass recalibration, MF assignment, signal-to-noise evaluation, and unambiguous formula selections are provided. This package contains MFAssign(), MFAssignCHO(), MFAssignAll(), SNplot(), SNcutCheck(), MFRecalList(), MFRecalCheck(), and IsoFiltR() described in the sections below. Caution with parameter settings and output evaluation is recommended.</p>
<p>The functions in the MFAssignR package were developed by adapting methods and algorithms from the peer reviewed literature. The following references are referred to in this document:</p>

<div id="molecular-formula-assignment" class="section level2">
<h2>Molecular Formula Assignment</h2>
<p>The molecular formula assignment algorithm in MFAssign was adapted from the low mass moiety CHOFIT assignment algorithm developed by Green and Perdue (2015). Briefly, the CHOFIT algorithm uses low mass moieties such as CH4O-1 and C4O-3 to move around in the O/C and H/C space to assign masses to CHO formulas. These low mass moieties efficiently assign CHO formulas without conventional loops. Additional combinatorial assignments with various heteroatoms are made using nested loops that subtract the mass of a heteroatom from the measured ion mass, creating a CHO “core” mass, which can then be assigned using the low mass moiety CHOFIT approach. This is further explained in Green and Perdue (2015) and Perdue and Green (2015).</p>
<div id="mfassign-functions" class="section level3">
<h3>MFAssign Functions</h3>
<p>In total there are 3 versions of MF Assign, including MFAssign(), MFAssignCHO(), and MFAssignAll(). Where MFAssign() and MFAssignAll() include external nested loops to assign additional heteroatoms, as described in Green and Perdue (2015) and MFAssignCHO() does not.</p>
<div id="mfassign" class="section level4">
<h4>MFAssign()</h4>
<p>Using the low mass moiety and combinatorial assignment approach, MFAssign() can be used to assign molecular formulas with 12C, 1H, and 16O and a variety of heteroatoms and isotopes, including 2H, 13C, 14N, 15N, 31P, 32S, 34S, 35Cl, 19F, and 37Cl. It can also assign Na+ adducts, which are common in positive ion mode. Due to the increasing number of chemically reasonable molecular formulas with the increasing number of possible elements and increasing molecular weight, the output will provide a list of ambiguous and unambiguous molecular formulas.</p>
<p>Advanced Kendrick mass and z* sorting tools are used to reduce the number of ambiguous molecular formulas in MFAssign(). First, Kendrick mass defect (KMD) and z* values are calculated with a CH2 Kendrick base to sort the measured masses into CH2 homologous series (Stenson et al., 2003). The function then selects 1 to 3 members of each CH2 homologous series with masses below the user defined cutoff and attempts to assign molecular formulas. The ambiguous MF are then returned to the unassigned list. Then, the unambiguous MF are used as seeds for additional assignments using CH2, O, H2, H2O, and CH2O molecular formula extensions (Kujawinski and Behn, 2006). To do the formula extensions the KMD and z* values for each of these bases are calculated and then used to assign MF through the addition or subtraction of the series bases. MFAssign() (and MFAssignCHO()) tracks how many different “paths” can be used to assign each formula and if a single mass has multiple formulas, the function will choose the formula that has the largest number of paths that intercept with it. For example, if a single mass has two possible MF and one has 20 potential “paths” to it, while the other has 4, the function will choose the MF with 20 paths. Work is ongoing to track these paths and the removed MF in the data frame output of these functions. Overall, the multi-path MF extension approach greatly reduces the number of ambiguous assignments and provides an increased level of confidence in the final MF list because the MF are related to unambiguous MF assigned below the user defined cut point.</p>
</div>
<div id="mfassigncho" class="section level4">
<h4>MFAssignCHO()</h4>
<p>MFAssignCHO() is a simplified version of MFAssign() used to assign CHO molecular formulas only. MFAssignCHO() runs faster than MFAssign() and is best used as a preliminary formula assignment step prior to the selection of recalibrant ions in conjunction with MFRecalList() and MFRecalCheck(), which are described below.</p>
</div>
<div id="mfassignall" class="section level4">
<h4>MFAssignAll()</h4>
<p>MFAssignAll() uses the low mass moiety and combinatorial assignment approach with a simplified MF extension approach. However, only the CH2 and H2O Kendrick bases are used for MF assignment. This function results in a significantly higher number of ambiguous MF and is best used to assign previously unassigned masses after MFAssign() or on short mass lists without a complex mixture.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="preliminary-isotope-filtering" class="section level3">
<h3>Preliminary Isotope Filtering</h3>
<p>The IsoFiltR() function can identify and pre-screen many of the 13C isotope masses, which can lower the number of peaks assigned an incorrect molecular formula. This function operates on a two column dataframe using the same structure as the MFAssign() function. IsoFiltR() works by finding the 13C Kendrick mass defects and then using those in conjunction with the CH2 z* values to differentiate the possible monoisotope/polyisotope pairs. For QA the function checks that the “polyisotopic 13C” peak is less than a certain fraction of the abundance of the “monoisotopic” peak. There are two data frame outputs from this function, “Mono” and “Iso”. The “Mono” dataframe contains the masses identified as likely monoisotopes from monoisotope/polyisotope pairs and the remaining unmatched masses The “Iso” dataframe contains only the masses that were identified as polyisotopic 13C masses from the monoisotope/polyisotope pairs.</p>
<p>When the two dataframe outputs from IsoFiltR() are put into MFAssign(), the function will match the assigned monoisotopic mass peaks to their corresponding polyisotopic mass peak. Additional work is needed to use the isotopes to reduce ambiguous molecular formula assignments assigned to a single mass. IsoFiltR() should not be considered as definitive proof of the presence or absence of polyisotopic 13C molecular formulas, but it does provide some ability to identify theses masses and limit the chances that they are incorrectly assigned with a monoisotopic formula.</p>
</div>
<div id="molecular-formula-quality-assurance" class="section level3">
<h3>Molecular Formula Quality Assurance</h3>
<p>MFAssign() includes a number of quality assurance (QA) steps to ensure that the assigned molecular formulas are chemically reasonable. Relatively lenient default settings are provided to avoid removing chemically reasonable ambiguous molecular formula assignments. Many of these parameters are customizable, including DBE-oxygen limits (Herzsprung et al. Anal. and Bioanal. Chem. 2014), oxygen-to-carbon ratio limits, hydrogen-to-carbon ratio limits, and minimum number of oxygen limits. The Hetcut parameter can be used to select the molecular formula with the lowest number of heteroatoms if more than one molecular formula is assigned to a single mass (Ohno and Ohno, 2013). The NMScut parameter identifies the CH4 vs O exchange series in each nominal mass as described in Koch et al. (2007), which can be used to limit ambiguous assignments. Additional non-adjustable QA parameters are used in MFAssign(), including the nitrogen rule, large atom rule, and the maximum number of hydrogen rule, maximum DBE rule (Lobodin et al., 2012), and the Senior rules (Kind et al. 2007).</p>

<div id="signal-to-noise-assessment" class="section level2">
<h2>Signal-to-Noise Assessment</h2>
<p>Signal-to-Noise level assessment can be accomplished using the SNcutCheck() and SNplot() functions, which are based on the method developed by Zhurov et al. (2014). This method uses the histogram distribution of the natural log intensities in a raw mass spectrum to determine the point where noise peaks give way to analyte signal. Additionally, the SNplot() function allows qualitative assessment of the effectiveness of the chosen S/N cut.</p>
<p>The SNcutCheck() function is used to estimate the signal-to-noise cut for the raw mass spectrum output mass list. The recommended signal-to-noise cut is reported in the console and a histogram showing the distribution of natural log of the abundance (or intensity) values is generated. The cut point is denoted using red for values below the cut point and blue for those above. This function should be run on the mass list prior to molecular formula assignment with MFAssign(). Setting a reasonable S/N cut point greatly increases the speed of the function and improves the output quality.</p>
<p>The SNplot function is used to show the mass spectrum with the formulas below the cut and above the cut denoted by the same colors as in the histogram plot from SNcutCheck.</p>

<div id="internal-mass-recalibration" class="section level2">
<h2>Internal Mass Recalibration</h2>
<p>MFRecalList() and MFRecalCheck() are functions pertaining to the internal mass recalibration method adapted from Kozhinov et al. (2013) using a polynomial central moving average to estimate the weights used to recalibrate the masses. The function MFRecalList() can be used with the output of MFAssign() or MFAssignCHO() to generate a data frame containing potential recalibrant CH2 homologous series. There are a variety of metrics included in the output of this function to aid the user in picking suitable recalibrant series, these are described in greater detail in the example of MFRecalList() below. The user can select up to 10 homologous series as inputs for the mass recalibration with MFRecalCheck(). MFRecalCheck() takes the chosen series and then uses the H2 and O KMD and z* series to identify additional formulas that are related to the chosen recalibrants. To avoid recalibration problems, the function assigns the user defined number of tallest peaks within a user defined mass range “bin” as recalibrants. For example, if the bin width is set at 20 and the number of peaks is set at 2, the function will select the two tallest peaks within each 20 m/z window across the range of the spectrum. The user can set the mass window bins and the number of peaks that will be chosen as recalibrants within each bin. This function then recalibrates the mass list and generates a plot with the input recalibrant series highlighted for a qualitative look at their overall quality.</p>

<div id="recommended-order-of-operations" class="section level2">
<h2>Recommended Order of Operations</h2>
<p>The functions will be described in the order that they are most effectively used. The functions do not have to be run in this order, but the best results will likely be obtained in this way. A list of the functions in the recommended order is given below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Run SNcutCheck() to determine the signal-to-noise cut point for the data</p></li>
<li><p>Check effectiveness of S/N cut point using SNplot()</p></li>
<li><p>Use IsoFiltR() to identify potential 13C isotope peaks</p></li>
<li><p>Using the S/N cut point determined by SNcutCheck(), and the two dataframes output from IsoFiltR(), run MFAssignCHO() to assign CHO formulas for use in identifying recalibrant ions.</p></li>
<li><p>Use MFRecalList() to generate a list of potential recalibrant series.</p></li>
<li><p>After choosing a few recalibrant series, use MFRecalCheck() to check whether they are good recalibrants and recalibrate the mass lists using those recalibrants.</p></li>
<li><p>Use MFAssign() with the recalibrated mass lists to assign molecular formulas to the data.</p></li>

<h2>Function Examples</h2>

<h3>Signal-to-Noise Functions</h3>
<p>The following two functions are used for mass lists containing noise.</p>
<div id="sncutcheck" class="section level4">
<h4>SNcutCheck()</h4>
<p>This function is an adaptation of the method developed by Zhurov et al. (2014). It is used to estimate the S/N cut point for raw mass spectral data from both FT-ICR and Orbitrap MS. In theory, there should be a significant first peak that contains the measured masses due to random noise. This function finds the valley between the random noise and the analyte signal of the histogram output. The output signal-to-noise can then be used to constrain the masses that are considered in the MFAssign() function. In some cases the data does not form the expected distribution, in which case, estimating the S/N cut point and checking it with SNplot() is likely the best course of action.</p>

<h3>Preliminary CHO Assignment</h3>

<h4>MFAssignCHO()</h4>
<p>MFAssignCHO() is a simpler version of MFAssign() that only assigns CHO molecular formulas. This can be helpful when trying to do a quick assignment prior to internal mass recalibration. The molecular formula assignment algorithm is based on the same principles as the full MFAssign(). It uses the CHOFIT algorithm to do a preliminary assignment of the CH2 homologous series on a subset of the masses and Kendrick Mass Defect and z* series analysis to extend the assignments to related remaining masses. An example of its usage is shown below, along with its input parameters.</p>

<div id="mfassigncho-parameters" class="section level5">
<h5>MFAssignCHO() Parameters</h5>
<ul>
<li><p>peaks - the input data frame with the measured ion mass in the first column followed by measured ion abundance in the second column. The column names can be anything.</p></li>
<li><p>isopeaks - the input isotopic masses dataframe with the same structure as “peaks”; if the two dataframes (peaks and isopeaks) come from the IsoFiltR function they will be formatted correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>ionMode - sets the ionization mode. It has two possible inputs; “pos” for positive mode and “neg” for negative mode. The options are case sensitive.</p></li>
<li><p>POEx - allows the assignment of positive odd electron ions. When it is set to 0, positive odd electron ions are not permitted (0 = off). When it is set to 1, positive odd electron ions are allowed (1 = on). The default is 0. This option is likely only needed in certain circumstances possibly including the assignment of ions measured after atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) or photoionization (APPI). Note, this only works for positive ion data and extra care must be taken with the assignments to ensure they are chemically reasonable.</p></li>
<li><p>NOEx - allows the assignment of negative odd electron ions. When it is set to 0, negative odd electron ions are not permitted (0 = off). When it is set to 1, negative odd electron ions are allowed (1 = on). The default is 0. This option is likely only needed in certain circumstances possibly including the assignment of ions measured after atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) or photoionization (APPI). Note, this only works for negative ion data and extra care must be taken with the assignments to ensure they are chemically reasonable.</p></li>
<li><p>lowMW - sets the minimum ion mass to be assigned. The default is 100.</p></li>
<li><p>highMW - sets the maximum ion mass to be assigned. The default is 1000.</p></li>
<li><p>Ex - sets the maximum number of 13C to be used in the function.</p></li>
<li><p>Mx - sets the maximum number of Na+ adducts to be used in the function. Note that this is important for most positive mode ESI data. The default is 0.</p></li>
<li><p>NH4x - sets the maximum number of NH4+ adducts to be used in the function. The default is 0. Note that this will replace one nitrogen and 4 hydrogens in a CHNO formula that does not have an NH4+ adduct, so great care should be taken with the formula assignments to understand if they are correct.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the addition of more heteroatoms or adducts will decrease the speed of the function. This is especially true if more than one type of heteroatom is allowed.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Zx - sets the maximum number of charges allowed. The default is 1. Theoretically, MFAssign() can assign multiply charged compounds, but not at this time.</p></li>
<li><p>Ox - sets the maximum number of O to be assigned. It also indirectly sets the number of loops for the core CHOFIT algorithm. Each core loop increases the number of oxygen by 3, which means that setting this value to 30 allows 10 loops of the inner algorithm, which seems to be a good balance between function speed and reasonable formula assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>ppm_err - sets the maximum allowable error for MF assignment and monoisotope/isotope peak matching. The value is in parts per million (ppm) and the default is 3.</p></li>
<li><p>SN - sets the signal-to-noise level for the data. This is useful if the signal-to-noise value for the data is known from an external source (such as SNcutCheck(). MFAssign() does not have the ability to independently determine the signal-to-noise level. The default is 0, and the input value must be consistent with the type of abundance in column 1 of peaks (i.e., intensity or relative abundance).</p></li>
<li><p>O_Cmin - sets the minimum allowable oxygen-to-carbon ratio for the assigned formulas. The default is 0.</p></li>
<li><p>O_Cmax - sets the maximum allowable oxygen-to-carbon ratio for the assigned formulas. The default is 2.5.</p></li>
<li><p>H_Cmin - sets the minimum allowable hydrogen-to-carbon ratio for the assigned formulas. The default is 0.1.</p></li>
<li><p>H_Cmax - sets the maximum allowable hydrogen-to-carbon ratio for the assigned formulas. The default is 3.</p></li>
<li><p>DBEOmin - sets the minimum allowable DBE minus oxygen value. The default is -13, consistent with Herzsprung et al. 2014.</p></li>
<li><p>DBEOmax - sets the maximum allowable DBE minus oxygen value. The default is 13, consistent with Herzsprung et al. 2014.</p></li>
<li><p>Omin - sets the minimum allowable number of oxygen for a molecular formula. The default is 0.</p></li>
<li><p>HetCut - this removes the ambiguous molecular formulas with a greater number of heteroatoms (heteroatoms are defined as all elements that are not C or H) if an MF with fewer heteroatoms was also assigned to the same mass. This parameter is based on Ohno and Ohno (2013).The default setting is “off” because this can sometimes lead to incorrect assignments if many heteroatoms are expected for the data. The only inputs are “on” or “off” and it is case sensitive.</p></li>
<li><p>NMScut - this is a QA parameter based on nominal mass patterns as described by Koch et al. (2007). It helps to decrease the number of ambiguous formulas. The default setting is “on”, to turn this option off the input is “off”.</p></li>
<li><p>DeNovo - this defines the m/z cut point below which formulas can be assigned with the CHOFIT algorithm and above which formulas are assigned with the formula extension method. The default setting is 1000 for CHO assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>nLoop - this defines the number of times that the formula extension component of MFAssignCHO() will loop to assign the masses not unambiguously assigned with the CHOFIT algorithm. The default number of loops is 5.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="recalibration-functions" class="section level3">
<h3>Recalibration Functions</h3>
<p>The following two functions are used for internal mass calibration: MFRecalList() provides qualitative metrics for the selection of possible recalibrant series and MFRecalCheck() performs a mass recalibration using the approach described in Kozhinov et al. (2013).</p>
<div id="mfrecallist" class="section level4">
<h4>MFRecalList()</h4>
<p>MFRecalList() is a function that takes the output of MFAssign() or MFAssignCHO() and provides metrics to rank the homologous series suitability to be used as recalibrants. The function selects CHO homologous series with at least three members. The homologous series are evaluated to determine the number of observations in each series (Number Observed), the mass range of each series (Mass Range), the mass of the tallest peak in each series (Tall Peak), and the “Abundance Score” which shows the percentage difference between the mean abundance of a homologous series and the median abundance within the mass range the “Tall Peak” of each series fall in (for example m/z 200-300). The output is a data frame with all eligible series present for the user to review. In general, a series with many members and a high abundance score is a good place to start. The goal in this recalibration method is to have recalibrants with high local abundance across the entire range of the spectrum.</p>

<h5>MFRecalList() Output</h5>
<p>The output is a data frame with nine columns which the user can use to inform their decision about which recalibrant series to choose.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Series - the molecular class (e.g., “O6”), the DBE (e.g., 3), and adduct type (“H” or “Na”) concatenated into a single term (class_Adduct_DBE). This series information is needed to identify which homologous series is to be used as a recalibrant in MFRecalCheck().</p></li>
<li><p>Number Observed - the number of observed masses in each homologous series.</p></li>
<li><p>Series Index - a number indicating the length of the series relative to the other identified series, the smaller the number the longer the series.</p></li>
<li><p>Mass Range - the mass range from the smallest member of the homologous series to the largest.</p></li>

The recalibration is based on the first step of the recalibration method described by Kozhinov et al. 2013, which uses a polynomial central moving average to estimate the weights used to recalibrate the masses. The recalibrated output can then be fed directly into MFAssign() in order to assign molecular formulas with the recalibrated masses. Additionally, the function will output a data frame containing the recalibrants with their original mass error and new, recalibrated mass error. To improve the mass recalibration across the studied mass range, this function finds additional recalibrants related by H2 or O homologous series using Kendrick mass analysis and then selects the tallest peaks within a user defined mass range.</p>

<h3>Final Molecular Formula Assignment</h3>
<div id="mfassign-1" class="section level4">
<h4>MFAssign()</h4>
<p>MFAssign() is the function used for the final MF assignment with heteroatoms. The general parameters and method of formula assignment are the same as MFAssignCHO(), the major difference is that multiple heteroatoms and isotopes can be included. However, an increasing number of chemically reasonable MF are possible with an increasing number of possible elements and increasing molecular weight. For this reason this function uses a multi-path MF extension approach to reduce the number of ambiguous assignments. Thus, the final MF list contains unambiguous MF that may have been selected based on relationships that are expected in environmental complex mixtures and ambiguous MF. Some unassigned masses are also expected to remain; these could be passed through MFAssignAll().</p>

<h3>Additional Assignments</h3>
<div id="mfassignall-1" class="section level4">
<h4>MFAssignAll()</h4>
<p>MFAssignAll() can be more effective at assigning isolated or unassigned masses from the other MFAssign functions. This version does not have a mass cut point and only performs rudimentary formula extension (CH2 and H2O only), which causes it to run somewhat slower than the other versions of the function, especially on large mass lists. Thus, this version is recommended to be run on limited mass lists, especially when trying to assign isolated masses. The lack of advanced formula extension and mass cut point allows for many more ambiguous formula assignments so care should be taken when interpreting the results.</p>

<div id="best-practices" class="section level2">
<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<p>Although many well-vetted methods of decreasing the number of MF assigned for each mass have been employed in the MFAssign functions, it is important to take time to assess the correctness of the assigned MF based on realistic expectations for the specific data being analyzed.</p>
<p>It is important to ensure each input parameter is set properly for the analysis being performed. There are warning messages that will be displayed if the parameters set are outside typical bounds (or include a typo), but these warnings will not stop the function from running. If too many heteroatoms are included, the runtime of the function will be greatly increased, and the results may become unwieldy. On the other hand, if too few or incorrect heteroatoms are included, the results may be unreasonable.</p>
<p>If at any time MFAssign(), MFAssignCHO(), or MFAssignAll() need to be stopped before they have completed, it will be necessary to run the following line of code “.rs.restartR()”. This is necessary to free up the memory so that the functions can be run at a reasonable speed in future attempts. This line is included within the MFAssign functions and so R will automatically restart as necessary to ensure continued good performance. Unfortunately, this prohibits running the function across multiple datasets in a loop, or in an R Markdown document. Work is ongoing to address this issue in a future release.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, limit the number of masses in the input data frame to a number as small a as possible since, the speed of the function decreases significantly with an increasing number of masses. The performance is reasonably good (~ &lt;= 60 sec) up to 10,000 masses with a moderate number of elements (3-5). However, both a higher number of masses being evaluated and higher maximum numbers of heteroatoms, decrease the function speed and can become unreasonable depending on the computer (e.g., &gt;30 minutes).</p>
<p>Setting a reasonable signal-to-noise cut point (SN) can be very important with regard to function speed. Prior to running a raw mass list you should attempt to estimate the SN or set it to a reasonable value. This can be done with SNcutCheck() and/or SNplot(). Otherwise the function will try to assign MF to every mass (including the noise), which slows down the function and increases the likelihood of incorrect assignments.</p>
<p>The two input columns can have any name, but it is very important that the measured ion mass is in the first column and the measured abundance (or ion intensity) is in the second column. The function only attempts to assign MF to the first column. It is also important to only put ion masses into the function, using neutral masses will not work.</p>
<div id="additional-notes-and-test-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Additional Notes and Test Data</h3>
<p>The current form of the package functions have significant reliance on dplyr and tidyr functions to do some aspects of the data manipulations.</p>
<p>There are multiple warning messages that are reported when the functions are being run. Unless the function stops working, these error messages do not otherwise impact the functioning of the code.</p>
<p>There are a variety of additional functions that are included in this package, but many of them are sub-functions that are necessary for the MFAssign functions and are not independently operational, these functions have not been described in this document. Only the independent functions have been described in this document.</p>
<p>There is a large mass list built into the package called CHNOS_ML_Ex which can be used to test whether the function is working correctly. It is a negative mode mass list with even electron ions generated by electrospray ionization. When a maximum of 3 nitrogen and 1 sulfur are allowed, MFAssign() should assign 2116 of 2121 total masses, when the DeNovo is set to 500 for MFAssign(). Additionally, there is a smaller data frame (Short_CHO_neg) of 13 observations randomly sampled from CHNOS_ML_Ex, which is more effective for checking whether or not formulas are correct. There is also an 8 observation data frame (Short_CHO_pos) of positive even electron ions generated by electrospray ionization, which can be used for checking the MFAssign parameters for positive ions and ensuring they assigning correctly. All functions should be able to assign all the masses in these short example data sets if the DeNovo cut point is set to 1000. Additionally, a raw mass list containing negative mode even ion data is included and can be used to test the SNcut, SNplot, IsoFiltR, MFRecal and MFAssign functions. Its name is Raw_Neg_ML.</p>
